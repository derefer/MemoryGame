# MemoryGame
Basic memory game in Unity

The project was based on this tutorial from "Awesome Tuts": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaCjBh7bWz0&list=PLZhNP5qJ2IA2DA4bzDyxFMs8yogVQSrjW

Additional changes compared to the tutorial:
..* Fix bug when clicking the same puzzle twice
..* Make it possible to replay or exit the game in the end
..* Extend the board from 8 to 18 puzzles using my own photos

This is the first piece of code I wrote (adapted) in C#, so it's probably not following the best practices.

Some screenshots from the Android version of the game:
